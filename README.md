# RicePestDetection

The project aims to develop an automated system to detect pest infestations on rice crops and apply pesticides selectively to the affected areas. This approach minimizes pesticide use, reduces environmental impact, and promotes sustainable agriculture.


## Features

**Image Classification for Pest Detection** \
-Utilizes advanced image processing techniques and machine learning algorithms to classify images captured from the rice fields. The system identifies specific pests harmful to rice crops by analyzing visual features.

**Integration of Image and Environmental Sensors** \
-Employs a combination of image sensors and environmental sensors to enhance the accuracy of pest detection and understand the pest's prevalence based on environmental factors.

**Automated Pesticide Application** \
-Uses a microcontroller-based system to control pesticide sprinklers. The system targets only the infected areas, applying the appropriate amount of pesticide based on the severity of the infestation.







## Tech Stack

**Machine/Deep Learning:** For image classification and pest identification.

**Microcontroller:** For automated control of sprinklers.

**IoT:** For real-time monitoring and data transmission.

**Environmental Sensors:** For monitoring crop conditions.
